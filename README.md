### Additional Note

During the lab exam, I was able to complete Problems 1 and 2, and partially worked on Problem 3 within the time limit. After the exam, I revisited the remaining problems to finish them as practice.

Problems 3 and 4 (`cell_number_extra.py` and `palindrome_extra.py`) were completed after the exam and are included here to show my continued effort to learn and improve, even though they were not part of the timed submission.
