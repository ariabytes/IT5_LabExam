### Additional Note
During the lab exam, I was only able to complete Problems 1 and 2, and partially Problem 3. After the exam, I revisited the remaining problems to complete them as practice. 

Problems 3 and 4 were finished after the exam and are included here to show my continued effort to learn and improve, even though they were not part of the timed submission.
